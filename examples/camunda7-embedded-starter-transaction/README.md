This example deploys three processes into an embedded process engine. 
Using Camunda Tasklist, start processes manually:

* Simple - will execute the worker successfully.
* Simple with Error - will create an incident and report correct exception in Camunda.
* Simple with BPMN Error - will throw BPMN Error and process will react to that.
